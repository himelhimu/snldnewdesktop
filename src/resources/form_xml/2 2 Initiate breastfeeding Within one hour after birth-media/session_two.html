                            Starting breastfeeding soon after birth helps mothers to provide enough milk later and establishes successful and exclusive breast feeding. Early breastfeeding encourages bonding between mother and baby and it also helps the uterus contract and reduces maternal bleeding. Breast milk, especially colostrum contains antibodies that protect babies against infection. It also provides nutrition, and is easily digestible. 
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Babies should receive only breast milk for the first 6 months (180 days). Babies who receive other food or liquids before 6 months of age are more likely to develop diarrhea, ARI and malnutrition. Counsel expectant mothers and family members about breastfeeding during antenatal visits and discuss it again before delivery.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            To encourage early breastfeeding, mother and babies need to be kept together. Babies are often alert immediately after birth and will move toward the motherâ€™s breast but may not suck. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Signs of readiness to feed include:</span> The baby opens eyes, seeks breast, turns head back slightly, opens mouth wide, and pushes tongue down and forward and licks.  Mothers need to recognize these signs and need to know how to encourage the baby to latch onto the nipple.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">1.  Benefits for the child</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>Breast milk is widely acknowledged as the most complete form of nutrition for babies, with a range of benefits for babies' health, growth, immunity and development</li>
                            <li>Breast-fed children are less likely to develop a number of diseases later in life, including juvenile diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart disease, and cancer before the age of 15</li>
                            <li>Formula-fed babies face a threefold greater risk of being hospitalized with a severe respiratory infection than those babies breast-fed for a minimum of four months</li>
                            <li>Diarrheal disease is three to four times more likely to occur in formula-fed babies than breast-fed babies</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">2.  Benefits for the mothers</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>
                                Mothers who breastfeed are less likely to develop osteoporosis later in life and have a lower risk of breast, uterine and endometrial or ovarian cancer
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Breastfeeding releases oxytocin that causes the uterus to return to its normal size more quickly
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Women who lactate for a total of two or more years reduce their chances of developing breast cancer by 24 percent
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The emotional health of the mother is enhanced by the relationship she develops during breastfeeding, resulting in a stronger sense of connection with her baby
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">3.  Benefits for the family</p>
                        <ul style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify; list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>
                                Breastfeeding also has economic advantages: it's cheaper than buying formula and helps avoid medical bills later because it helps equip the baby to fight off disease and infection
                            </li>
                        </ul>
