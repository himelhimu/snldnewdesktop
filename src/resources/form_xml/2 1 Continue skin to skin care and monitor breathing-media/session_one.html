                            A baby begins to lose heat immediately after birth. Heat loss can be prevented, early breastfeeding and bonding can be established and low body temperature can be avoided by following steps: 
                        </p>
                        <ol style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
                            <li>Dry the baby immediately after birth and remove wet towels or clothing; </li>
                            <li>Place the baby between breasts;</li>
                            <li>Cover the mother and baby with a clean, dry cloth or blanket. Cover the babyâ€™s head with a cap, and both hands and feet with socks;</li>
                            <li>Please maintain delivery room temperature between 250C/770F to 280C/82.40F.</li>

                            Skin-to-skin care should begin at birth and should continue for at least two hours. During first two hours, skin-to-skin care should be interrupted only for essential care, such as weighing, and should resume as soon as possible. Interruptions should be as brief as possible, and only areas necessary for care should be uncovered.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Rapid breathing after birth often occurs while normal lung fluid is being absorbed. Rapid breathing usually resolves by one to two hours after birth. However, rapid breathing that continues may be caused by a more serious problem that requires advanced care. All babies should be monitored every 15 minutes for rapid breathing (>60 breaths/min) and chest in-drawing until the time of the first complete examination for first two hours after birth. This can be done by observation alone without handling if the baby appears normal.
