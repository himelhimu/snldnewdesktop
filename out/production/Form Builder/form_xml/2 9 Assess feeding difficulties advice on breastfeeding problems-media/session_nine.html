                            Counseling for breastfeeding should be started during the antenatal period. Problems with the breasts during the first one or two weeks following delivery are common and interfere successful breastfeeding. Before discharge, mothers should be checked for any breastfeeding problems and advised accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Flat/Short/Inverted nipple </span>makes attachment to the breast difficult. These should be diagnosed in the antenatal period and mothers will need additional support to feed their babies. 
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Management should be started just after birth of the baby. Short nipple can be manually stretched and rolled out several times a day. For flat and inverted nipple, a 10 or 20 cc plastic syringe is used to draw-out the nipple. Cut the needle end of the syringe, take out the plunger and insert it through the cut end, so that the syringe may be used to pull out the inverted nipple.   
                        </p>
                        
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Breast engorgement </span> means that mother’s breasts are very full, tight and shiny. Having full breast in the first 36 – 72 hours is normal; however fullness involves both breast and does not reduce milk production of mother. Management should include warm compression, frequent feeding and/or manual expression of milk to ensure emptying. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Sore or cracked nipples </span>result from poor attachment or a skin infection. Encourage and ensure good attachment and continued breastfeeding or expression of milk. Provide treatment if there is infection. Counsel mothers to clean their breasts once a day with clean warm water and avoid soaps, medicated lotions and ointments. Apply the last drops of breast milk (hind milk) to the cracked nipple after each feeding.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Mastitis </span>may be caused by blocked duct or infection in the breast. Breast becomes painful, red and hard, usually one breast is affected and often it’s associated with fever. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Counsel mothers not to stop breastfeeding. Medicine (e.g. Ibuprofen) may also help. If these treatments do not improve the condition in 24 hours, treat with antibiotics. Failure to treat can result in an abscess formation and a need for surgical drainage.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #1B6836;">Improve milk production </span>by massaging the back and neck, massaging the breasts and nipples, and increasing maternal fluid-intake.
