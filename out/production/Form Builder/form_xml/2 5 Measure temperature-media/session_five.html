                            A newborn is prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area, lack of subcutaneous fat and less amount of brown fat especially among premature and low birth weight and sick infants. A cold baby is less active, does not breast feed well, become hypoglycemic, weakly cry, and develop respiratory distress. If the baby remains cold, these symptoms become more severe and the baby is prone to develop DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) eventually leading to death. Keeping the babies temperature normal improves outcome and can avoid death.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Low body temperature is common in the first few hours of birth. It can be prevented by keeping the baby warm by prolonged skin-to-skin care or advanced care. Temperature below 35.50C/ 95.90F is considered as a danger sign.  A temperature above 37.50C/ 99.50F which is not due to excess warming is also considered as a danger sign. However, hypothermia is the single most fatal danger sign for newborn.

                        <h3 style="color: #1B6836;">Baby’s temperature can be assessed by touch:</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Baby’s temperature can be assessed reasonably by touching the abdomen, hand and feet with the dorsum of your hand. In newborns, abdominal temperature is representative of the core temperature. When feet are cold and abdomen is warm, it indicates the baby is in cold stress. In hypothermia, both feet and abdomen are cold to touch.
                        </p>

                        <h3 style="color: #1B6836;">Baby with normal temperature - both body and feet are warm to touch.</h3>
                        <h3 style="color: #1B6836;">Axillary temperature is as good as rectal temperature but much safer, and is measured for three minutes.</h3>

                            <li>
                                Wash your hands before, and keep baby warm throughout the procedure
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Make sure the thermometer is clean
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Shake it down, so that it reads less than 350C/ 950F
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                After cleaning and drying, place the silver/red/bulb end of the thermometer under the baby’s arm in the middle of the armpit parallel to the long axis of the body
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Gently hold the baby’s arm against the body
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keep the thermometer in place for three minutes

                                Remove the thermometer and take the exact reading
