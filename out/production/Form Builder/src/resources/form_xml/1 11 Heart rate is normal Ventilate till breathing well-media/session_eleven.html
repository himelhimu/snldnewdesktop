                            If the heart rate is normal, continue to ventilate until the baby is breathing well. Gradually reduce the rate of ventilation and look for the baby’s breathing. If the heart rate stays normal as the baby begins to breathe, stop ventilation. Ventilation can be stopped when the baby is breathing and the heart rate stays normal (more than 100 beats per minute).
                        </p>

                            Monitor the baby who is breathing after ventilation.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Monitor the baby with the mother. Extended skin-to-skin care may be of special value to the small or sick baby who required ventilation. Monitor vital signs including breathing, heart rate, temperature, and color. A baby who received ventilation with bag and mask may need assistance for feeding. Talk to mother and the birth companion about the baby and the plan of care.
                        </p>
                        <h3 style="color: #1B6836;">
                            Continue ventilation and seek advanced care if the baby is not breathing or breathing with difficulty.

                                A baby who has a normal heart rate and pink color but does not breathe needs continued ventilation. A slow decrease in the rate of ventilation over several minutes may allow return of spontaneous breathing. If the baby still does not breathe, continue ventilation and consider special consultation and/or referral

                            <li>
                                The baby who begins to breathe, but has difficulty in breathing and a slow heart rate without ventilation needs continued ventilation and special care

                                Severe chest in-drawing, grunting, or frequent pauses in breathing (longer than 15 to 20 seconds) may require mechanical support of breathing.
                            </li>

                            A baby who has received continued ventilation (longer than 5 minutes) needs close monitoring and special consultation or referral to tertiary level facility. Warmth and assistance with feeding will be necessary.
