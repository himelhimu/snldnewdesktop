                            If the heart rate is slow, all the steps to improve ventilation should be ensured.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            There may be a serious underlying problem like pneumonia, meconium aspiration, immature lungs (prematurity) or a congenital malformation. The baby may need endotracheal intubation and supplemental oxygen or chest compressions and medications. 
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Activate the emergency plan to access advanced care at a specialized facility/unit. If service is not available in the facility refer for advance care. Continue ventilation during transport for advanced care.
                        </p>

                            Transport mother and baby together.
                        </h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Continue to monitor baby’s breathing, heart rate, color and temperature closely. Communicate your assessment and the actions you have taken to the responsible person at the receiving facility. Try to keep mother and baby together during transfer, even if only one is ill. Consider skin-to-skin care during transport to protect the baby from cold stress.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            If the baby has no heart rate and no breathing after giving ventilation for 20 minutes, the baby is dead. Counsel parents and stop ventilation.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Skin that is purple-white or peeling (maceration) suggests that a baby died long before delivery. If recognized at delivery, ventilation does not need to begin. Ventilation can be stopped whenever maceration is recognized. No intervention is indicated. A baby who never had a heart rate and never breathed after birth is stillbirth.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Support the family of a baby who is ill or who died.Explain to the family of a sick baby what is the problem and what can be done to help. Respond in a culturally appropriate way.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Answer the family’s questions or find help to answer them. Respect the family’s wishes, privacy, and religious beliefs. Give the mother advice on breast care and family planning.
                        </p>
